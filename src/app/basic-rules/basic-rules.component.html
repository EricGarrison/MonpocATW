            If you're new to Monsterpocalypse (or want a simplified version of this game mode), then start here.  All perks are the same for all alliances.  All perks are replaced when using advanced alliance perks.

            All units and monsters in your force must be from the same alliance.
            <br>
            You gain certain abilities based on your alliance's control.
